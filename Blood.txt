THe file that you see "Blood.cpp" was created by me and this is the readme file for that.
This file "Blood.cpp" is the main file and it uses txt files to store the data that you have extered.
However when you run the code on your computer for the first time there is no txt file created to store the data.
Now there are some issues in this code not sollved by me... for eg - you try to search the data for the first time you ran the code and
there is no txt file present....
There are more small-small issues in this code that needs to be solved.
